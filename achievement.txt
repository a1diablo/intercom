I'm not sure if pride is the right word but it definitely feels
 good to finish some programming challenges. The ones which keep
 us awake the longest or the ones which conquer our dreams are
 often the ones remembered for long, for good or bad. During my
 experience as a Software Engineer at Bluestacks, I got to relish
 many such experiences but the one I fondly remember was about
 building a video conferencing app in the timeline of a month.
 Not only the WebRTC framework seemed daunting but the whole video
 communication thing seemed far from the programming domains I was
 familiar with, along with the realization that I'd to do it on iOS
 which was a new learning track as well. The technical complexity
 encountered, helped to build an approach towards understanding
 and building complex pieces of software and the ability to
 communicate with our manager over the same application in the US
 gave a blissful closure to the process.
